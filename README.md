# 🚀 Day 1: Getting Started with .NET and C#

📅 **Date:** 18 December 2025
🎯 **Goal:** Understand the fundamentals of the .NET platform and C# language

---

## ✨ Overview

Day 1 focused on building a strong foundation by understanding **what .NET is**, **why C# is used**, and **how code actually runs behind the scenes**.

---

## 📌 Key Learnings

* 🔹 Introduction to the **.NET platform** and its real-world use cases
* 🔹 Basics of the **C# programming language** and its role in .NET
* 🔹 Environment setup using **Visual Studio** and **.NET SDK 8**

## ⚙ How C# Code Executes

1. C# source code is compiled into **Intermediate Language (IL)**
2. IL is executed at runtime by the **Common Language Runtime (CLR)**
3. CLR handles:

   * Memory management
   * Type safety
   * Exception handling

🔍 Also discussed the **Compiler vs Interpreter** concept for better clarity.

---

## 🛠 Best Practices & Insights

* 📈 Evolution of **C# versions** and language improvements over time
* 🧾 Importance of **naming conventions** in code
* 📝 Writing clean and meaningful **Git commit messages**

---

## ✅ Outcome

By the end of Day 1, I gained a clear understanding of:

* The .NET ecosystem
* How C# programs run internally
* How to properly set up a development environment
