# 📅 Day 33 — Introduction to ThreadPool in Multithreading

**Date:** 06/02/2026
**Topic:** ThreadPool in C#

---

## 🧩 Key Learnings

### 🔹 ThreadPool in C#
- **ThreadPool** provides a pool of reusable threads managed by the runtime.
- Helps in **efficiently executing multiple short-lived tasks** without creating new threads each time.

### 🔹 Benefits
- Reduces **overhead** of thread creation and destruction.
- Improves **performance and resource management** for concurrent tasks.
- Automatically manages the **number of active threads** based on system workload.

### 🔹 Use Cases
- Ideal for **scenario-based problems** requiring many small tasks.
- Suitable for **I/O operations, background processing, and task scheduling**.

### ⚡ Best Practices
- Avoid long-running tasks in the ThreadPool to prevent **blocking other tasks**.
- Prefer using **Task Parallel Library (TPL)** for more advanced and flexible task management.
- Monitor thread pool usage to ensure **efficient resource utilization**.

# 📅 Day 34 — Introduction to Task & async/await in Multithreading

**Date:** 09/02/2026
**Topic:** Task-Based Asynchronous Programming in C#

---

## 🧩 Key Learnings

### 🔹 Tasks in C#
- **Task** represents an asynchronous operation that can run concurrently with other tasks.
- Provides **better control over threading** compared to manually creating threads.

### 🔹 async/await
- **async** marks a method as asynchronous.
- **await** pauses the execution of a method until the awaited task completes, without blocking the main thread.
- Simplifies writing **asynchronous, non-blocking code** for I/O operations and long-running tasks.

### 🔹 Benefits
- Improves **application responsiveness**.
- Reduces complexity compared to manual thread management.
- Ensures **efficient resource utilization** in multithreaded applications.

### ⚡ Best Practices
- Keep async methods **short and focused**.
- Avoid blocking calls inside async methods.
- Combine **Task and async/await** with proper exception handling for robust applications.

# 📅 Day 35 — MSSQL Programming Concepts

**Date:** 10/02/2026
**Topic:** Advanced SQL Programming & Database Control

---

## 🧩 Key Learnings

### 🔹 Core MSSQL Concepts
- Practiced SQL syntax, **constraints**, and **keys** to ensure data integrity.
- Learned best practices for database schema design and relational modeling.

### 🔹 Joins & Subqueries
- Implemented **INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, and FULL joins** for data retrieval.
- Used **nested queries** to solve complex retrieval scenarios.

### 🔹 Aggregations & Grouping
- Applied **aggregate functions** (SUM, COUNT, AVG) and **GROUP BY** for analyzing data efficiently.

### 🔹 Stored Procedures & Functions
- Created **stored procedures** and **user-defined functions** to encapsulate reusable logic.

### 🔹 Views & Security
- Used **views** for abstraction and simplified data access.
- Applied **DCL commands** to manage user roles, permissions, and security.

### 🔹 Cursors
- Explored **row-by-row data processing** using cursors for specific use cases.
