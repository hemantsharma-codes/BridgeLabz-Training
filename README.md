# 📅 Day 13: Advanced Concepts of Polymorphism & Abstraction in C#
**Date:** 05 January 2026

Allows different classes to implement the same method.
Enables flexible and loosely coupled code.

## 🔹 Polymorphism with Abstract Classes
Derived classes override base class methods.
Runtime method selection is supported.

## 🔹 Casting and is Operator with Polymorphism in C#
Casting converts base reference to derived type.
`is` operator checks type safety before casting.

## 🔹 Abstraction
Focuses on what an object does, not how.
Hides internal implementation details.

## 🔹 Abstract Class
Cannot be instantiated.
Contains abstract and concrete methods.

## 🔹 Interface
Defines a contract for classes.
Supports multiple inheritance.

## 🔹 Comparison Between Abstract Class and Interface
Abstract class supports implementation.
Interface supports only declarations.

## 🔹 Interface vs Class
Class represents state and behavior.
Interface represents behavior only.
